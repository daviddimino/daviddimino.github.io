        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Business Administration with a minor in Aviation. I don't have a job so I trade stocks and cryptocurrencies for money.</p>
         <p>
            I love to travel the world, play sports including baseball, soccer, golf, and parkour, as well as a long list of random hobbies that would take too long to type out. My Chick-Fil-A order is a Spicy Chicken Sandwich with pepper jack cheese and no pickles, water no ice. My favorite number is the number "7" because it just looks really sleek and mysterious, yada yada yada.  
         </p> 
         <p>
            That's pretty much all there is to know about me.
